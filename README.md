# wordle-terminal
A clone of the popular wordle game, but for the terminal! Having it in the terminal lets you play the game infinitely, not just daily. You also get to play a quick game when you're bored of programming.

# Installation
Clone the github repository using the "Clone" button, and navigate to that folder on your machine. Open a terminal in the `wordle-terminal` directory, and continue on with the installation.


I've created a handy-dandy installation script that will install everything for you. To use it, type `./setup.sh` in the terminal. I assume that you already have Python installed and virtualenv. Once the script has installed the all of the requirements, the game should pop up. You can run the project with `python main.py` in the terminal.

# Playing the game
This should play just like the normal wordle game, but if you encounter any bugs, feel free to message me or make a pull request.

### Commands:
- `quit` will exit the game
