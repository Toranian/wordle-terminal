# wordle-terminal
A clone of the popular wordle game, but for the terminal!

## Why?
I played the wordle game, and thought it would be fun to play the game whenever I pleased, instead of once per day. I know that there are sites you can go to already that do this, but I thought it would be more fun to build it myself, plus, I can just type "wordle" in my terminal now to play a quick game.
